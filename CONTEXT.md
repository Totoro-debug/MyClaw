# Personal Agent Runtime

This context defines the language for an independently designed, local-first, single-user Personal Agent runtime.

## Language

**Personal Agent**:
A local-first, single-user Agent runtime that works continuously for one person through a Command-line Conversation.
_Avoid_: Bot platform, multi-tenant assistant, channel-first agent, agent platform

**Agent Home**:
The fixed account-global home of one Personal Agent installation, separate from every Workspace and Conversation Session.
_Avoid_: Project workspace, session directory, install directory, configurable data root

**Workspace**:
The user-selected directory that scopes one Personal Agent interaction and owns its non-global state and file capabilities.
_Avoid_: Agent Home, install directory, session directory, project ID

**Workspace State**:
Persistent Personal Agent state owned by exactly one Workspace rather than by the installation or operating-system account.
_Avoid_: Agent Home, project source, global state, cache

**Message Bus**:
The transient pair of Inbound and Outbound queues shared by one Command-line Conversation and its current Agent Loop for foreground conversation flow.
_Avoid_: persistent event log, broadcast bus, Schedule queue

**Inbound Message**:
One ordinary user input waiting in the Message Bus for serial foreground processing.
_Avoid_: Management Command, Tool Confirmation, cancellation command, Agent Event

**Outbound Message**:
One transient presentation message emitted by an Agent Loop for its Command-line Conversation.
_Avoid_: Agent Event, Session message, diagnostic log, broadcast event

**Agent Run Activity Group**:
A user-visible group of non-final model output and Tool activity belonging to one foreground Agent Run, distinct from that run's final output.
_Avoid_: Conversation, Agent Run, event log, transcript

**Command-line Conversation**:
The primary user-facing conversation with the Personal Agent, presented as a full-screen terminal experience.
_Avoid_: Terminal session, shell command, chat channel, one-shot command, plain REPL

**Management Command**:
An explicit user command for inspecting or changing runtime-managed state without relying on natural-language conversation.
_Avoid_: Tool call, chat instruction, task management, one-shot conversation

**Management Port**:
The boundary through which Management Commands use runtime capabilities without knowing their storage or implementation details.
_Avoid_: Message Bus, direct file access, admin API

**Runtime Lifetime**:
The lifetime of one Command-line Conversation process, including every Runtime Generation it owns over time.
_Avoid_: Detached mode, daemon mode, persistent background process, one-shot command

**Runtime Generation**:
One replaceable set of Session-bound runtime components owned by a Runtime Lifetime.
_Avoid_: Runtime Lifetime, Conversation Session, Agent Run

**Session Log**:
Workspace-owned technical diagnostics associated with one Conversation Session rather than with the whole installation.
_Avoid_: Runtime Log, Conversation log, chat transcript, audit log, activity feed

**Agent Loop**:
The Session-scoped product orchestrator that owns foreground state, consumes Inbound Messages serially, invokes Agent Runs, and publishes Outbound Messages through the Command-line Conversation's Message Bus.

**Agent Runner**:
A reusable, Session-independent engine that performs one bounded model-and-Tool ReAct loop for any request that requires ReAct.
_Avoid_: Agent Loop, Conversation Session, Runtime Lifetime, Provider retry loop, single model call

**Agent Run**:
One complete Agent execution for one input against one Conversation Session, from input acceptance through its final outcome and persistence request.
_Avoid_: Agent Turn, Runtime, Model call, Tool call

**ReAct Cycle**:
One assistant response that requests Tools together with every corresponding Tool result completed before the next model request; a terminal assistant response without Tool calls ends the Agent Run instead of starting another cycle.
_Avoid_: Agent Run, Model call, individual Tool call, Provider retry

**Blackboard**:
A hidden task definition attached to a Conversation Session and its foreground Agent Runs, containing one current goal and one completion boundary. It supports interpretation without controlling execution or exposing a task-management surface.
_Avoid_: Task list, plan, workflow state, progress tracker

**Task Framing**:
The interpretation of an eligible new foreground user input against the current Blackboard and latest assistant response to keep, replace, or clear the current task definition. It is mutually exclusive with a Manual Skill Invocation in the same Agent Run.

The proactive compression threshold for a Model Route, calculated as `ceil(Available Context * Runtime compact_ratio)`; it triggers compaction before the hard input capacity is exhausted.
_Avoid_: Available Context, model context limit, output token limit

**Skill**:
A named, discoverable instruction package that guides an Agent Run through existing capabilities without registering Tools or expanding permissions.
_Avoid_: Tool, Plugin, Management Command, capability extension

**Long-term Memory**:
A Workspace-level durable memory of stable information intended to influence later Agent behavior across Conversation Sessions.

A durable external representation of an oversized successful Tool result associated with one Conversation Session.
_Avoid_: Tool result, attachment, memory entry

**Tool Result Micro-compression**:
An Agent Run model-context projection that omits oversized results from eligible earlier ReAct Tool messages after that run has made more than ten such Tool calls, without changing the returned Tool messages or persisted Session history.
_Avoid_: Tool Artifact, Tool result deletion, Tool execution truncation, permission filtering

**Schedule**:
The domain encompassing persistent scheduled tasks and the service that manages and runs them.
_Avoid_: Scheduled Work, a single scheduled task, the scheduling service

**Schedule Job**:
One Workspace-owned persistent task in the Schedule domain with its own execution timing. A user-created Schedule Job has its own Conversation Session; a System Schedule Job may use a dedicated internal executor.

_Avoid_: Model string, provider selection, backend, ad hoc route

**Reasoning Effort**:
A five-level intent attached to one Model Route that asks its Model Provider to trade response capability and thoroughness against latency and cost for each request.
_Avoid_: Thinking level, token budget, Conversation Session override

**Model Provider**:
A configured backend that implements model calls for one or more Model Routes.
_Avoid_: Model Route, model string, gateway

**User Configuration**:
