# Centralize Agent Loop Model Request Context Construction

`ContextBuilder` is the sole construction boundary for System Prompts and initial Model Request Contexts used by `AgentLoop`, including foreground chat, Schedule Jobs, Session title generation, preflight, and foreground summary-budget projections. It owns the Workspace, Agent Home, timezone, `MemoryManager`, and `SkillLoader`; it reads the current Long-term Memory snapshot when constructing a System Prompt and reads the Skill Loader's current frozen Skill state. It exposes both focused prompt methods and complete message-building methods and does not accept Tool schemas. Current User Messages use the configured local time. A Schedule projection captures its timestamp and System Prompt once so asynchronous budget checks and execution share those values; a foreground projection holds its captured Skill state stable across asynchronous preparation.

`SkillLoader` owns the frozen Skill state directly. Each successful `load()` atomically replaces that state, while failure preserves the previous state. The `/reload_skill` Management Command calls the current Agent Loop's loader directly: an active Agent Run keeps its captured Skill projection, and later requests use the reloaded state without rebuilding the Agent Loop or clearing its Conversation Session. A successful reload returns the new Skill metadata to the Terminal so its completion cache changes with the model-visible catalog and Manual Skill resolution; a failed reload leaves all three views unchanged.

`Blackboard` owns Task Framing generation, prompt construction, model invocation, parsing, and reduction through an asynchronous class method. Conversation Summary and Dream retain locally owned System Prompt and request assembly because they are separate execution responsibilities. `AgentRunner` remains independent from `ContextBuilder`, consumes complete initial messages, and owns ReAct transcript increments and repair messages. Tool schemas remain owned by Tool Gateway and request/status call sites rather than Context Builder.

Model-visible structural wrappers use Markdown. Substantive versioned System Prompt content remains in the `myclaw.templates` package and is not asserted verbatim by tests; single-use assembly-only templates are inlined at their construction sites. Tests verify message roles, ordering, dynamic projection, isolation, escaping, Markdown structure, and execution behavior instead of static prompt wording.

Requirements: [context construction and Skill reload](https://github.com/Totoro-debug/myclaw/issues/203).
