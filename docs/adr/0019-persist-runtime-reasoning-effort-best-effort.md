# Persist Runtime Reasoning Effort Best-Effort After Memory Commit

Reasoning Effort has five levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`, with `medium` as the configuration default. Runtime selection applies to `chat` and `default` requests and survives Session replacement; explicitly configured `memory` and `schedule` routes retain their own values.

The shared `ModelRouter` remains the Runtime Lifetime authority for the current Reasoning Effort. A successful
`/effort` update publishes that in-memory value before it performs any User Configuration I/O. The Management
Port owns this ordering, so a configuration failure cannot prevent the next logical model request from using the
committed value or cancel an active Agent Run.

`ConfigLoader.update_reasoning_effort()` is a narrow domain operation. It rereads the latest `config.toml`, uses a
`tomlkit` round-trip to preserve comments, table order, credentials, and unrelated settings, updates the
`default` route, and updates `chat` only when that table is explicitly present. It validates the complete candidate
configuration before making exactly one same-directory atomic replacement. It never materializes a missing `chat`
route and does not use the startup `UserConfiguration` snapshot as a write source.

All MyClaw operations that replace `config.toml` serialize through the stable `.config.toml.lock` sidecar in Agent
Home. Each operation acquires the OS-backed process lock before rereading the latest document and holds it through
validation and atomic replacement, so cooperating MyClaw writers cannot publish from the same stale source. Lock
acquisition has a fixed one-second timeout. A timeout or lock failure follows the operation's existing best-effort
failure path.

Persistence is deliberately best effort. Parse, validation, and replacement failures leave the published runtime
value intact; Management records one safe diagnostic containing only the stable operation and exception type, then
returns the normal successful selection result. It does not log configuration contents, credentials, or a traceback.
Temporary divergence between Runtime Lifetime status and the on-disk User Configuration is accepted until a later
successful update or process restart.

The serialization guarantee applies only to MyClaw writers that use this lock. An ordinary external editor does not
participate and must not save `config.toml` during a MyClaw write transaction; atomic replacement prevents partial
files but cannot merge an arbitrary concurrent external write. This decision does not add a general mutation
framework, rollback transactions, or a global mutable User Configuration aggregate. Provider retry/fallback
behavior, Session state, and Agent Loop ownership are unchanged.
